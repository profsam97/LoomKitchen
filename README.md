We want to build a dummy restaurant dashboard that has the following features. 
1. Login page  2. Restaurant search bar with Auto complete
3. A map that shows up list of locations where the restaurants is present on the map. 
4. A bookmark and remove button to each map.     
1. Maps where we click on like button should go to a liked restaurants page  
2. Maps where we click on remove button should be removed.
5. The bookmark/remove button actions need to be stateful on the same device(You need to store and retrieve them from cookie in the browser).
6. The UI should look intuitive. Use your best colors/themes.
